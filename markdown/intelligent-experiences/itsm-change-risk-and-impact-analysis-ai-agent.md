# Change risk and impact analysis AI agent

This AI agent evaluates the risks and potential impacts associated with a provided change request.

## Workflow

The agent collaborates with the user to identify and suggest the risks and impacts, revising the analysis based on feedback.

1.  Fetch the current change request details.
2.  Search for similar past change requests.
3.  If no similar past change data is available, ask the user: `No similar past change requests were found. Would you like to proceed with generating a risk and impact analysis based on best practices?`
4.  If the user agrees to proceed, continue to the next step; otherwise, stop execution.
5.  Generate a draft risk and impact analysis based on either the retrieved similar change requests or best practices.
6.  Present the risk and impact analysis to the user and ask for their feedback.
7.  Revise the risk and impact analysis based on the user’s feedback.
