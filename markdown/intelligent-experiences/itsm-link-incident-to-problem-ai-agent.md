# Link incident to problem AI agent

This AI agent links an incident to a problem that was created in the last six months.

## Workflow

The agent ensures a structured and automated approach to retrieving incident details, verifying an existing parent incident or problem linkages, and linking incidents to relevant problems only if a valid match is confirmed.

1.  Use the Get Incident and relevant Problems tool to fetch incident details and relevant problems.
2.  Compare incident and problem short descriptions to find a highly confident match with a problem that is contextually relevant to the incident. If no matches are found, end the workflow.
3.  Link the problem to the incident.
4.  Inform the user.
