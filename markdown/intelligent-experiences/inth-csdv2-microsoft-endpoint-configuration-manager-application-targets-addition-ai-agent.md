# Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager application targets addition AI agent

This AI agent adds collections as deployment targets to applications in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. It collects the collection, application, and deployment settings, confirms the request with the user, and reports the result.

## Workflow

The agent helps the user deploy an application in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager by adding a collection as a target of that application.

1.  Ask the user for the collection type and the collection name or ID.
2.  Look up the collection by name and, if several match, ask the user to choose the correct one.
3.  Ask for the application name or ID.
4.  Look up the application by name and, if several match, ask the user to choose the correct one.
5.  Ask whether the deployment should install or uninstall the application, and whether its purpose is Available or Required.
6.  Ask whether to use the default enforcement deadline or a date and time that the user specifies.
7.  Summarize the deployment details and ask the user to confirm.
8.  Add the collection as a target of the application and report the result, or explain any error that occurred.
