# Password reset AI voice agent

This AI voice agent helps users reset their password during phone-based interactions.

## Workflow

The agent sends a password reset link through email or SMS to ensure a successful reset.

1.  Verify the name of the password reset application. If not provided, ask the user to describe or name the application.
2.  Call the application search tool with the provided name to retrieve possible matches.
3.  If the tool returns multiple matches, ask clarifying questions.
4.  Confirm the selected application and explicitly ask for the delivery method \(email address, phone number, or reading out a URL\).
5.  Send or read out the password reset link based on the confirmed method.
