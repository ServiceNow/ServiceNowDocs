# User resource recommender AI agent

The agent filters and ranks users by relevance and adds the top-ranked users to the input record. It runs without user interaction by using the context that starts it.

## Workflow

The agent recommends users for a record without asking the user for input.

1.  Validate the record that started the agent. Stop without a message if the record isn't supported.
2.  Rank the users from the user pool.
3.  Display the top-ranked users and add them to the record.
4.  End with the message Squad Recommendation completed.
