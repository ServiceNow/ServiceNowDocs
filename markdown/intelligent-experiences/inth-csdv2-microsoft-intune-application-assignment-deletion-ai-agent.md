# Microsoft Intune application assignment deletion AI agent

This AI agent deletes application assignments in Microsoft Intune, which removes a group as a target of an application. It identifies the group, application, and assignment intent, confirms the request with the user, and reports the result.

## Workflow

The agent helps the user remove an application assignment from a group in Microsoft Intune.

1.  Ask the user for the group name or ID.
2.  Look up the group by name and, if several match, ask the user to choose the correct one.
3.  Ask for the application name or ID.
4.  Look up the application by name and, if several match, ask the user to choose the correct one.
5.  Ask for the intent of the assignment to delete.
6.  Ask the user to confirm the request.
7.  Delete the application assignment and report the result, or explain any error that occurred.
