# Success health monitor AI agent

The agent retrieves metric trend analysis for engagements. It creates a risk signal or risk occurrence for each engagement whose health metrics are declining.

## Workflow

The agent monitors engagement health and creates risk records without asking the user for input.

1.  Fetch the metric trend data for the engagements.
2.  Identify the engagements that need a risk record from the trend summaries, and display the list to the user.
3.  Create a risk signal or risk occurrence for each engagement on the list. The short description includes the engagement title and the reason, Health Declined, and the description includes the metric trend analysis.
