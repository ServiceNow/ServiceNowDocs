# Custom app recommendations AI agent

This ServiceNow Vault agent lists the custom apps on the instance, and shows recommendations along with the available protections for the selected apps.

## Workflow

1.  Verify the classification recommendations skill is active on the instance.
2.  Retrieve all installed custom apps and present them for selection.
3.  Analyze the selected app's data to identify columns that contain sensitive data needing classification, along with available protection options.
4.  Present the recommendations to the user and get explicit confirmation before applying anything.
5.  Process and apply the recommended data classifications, then display a summary of what was classified.
6.  Provide a link to Vault so the user can set up data protections for the newly classified data.
