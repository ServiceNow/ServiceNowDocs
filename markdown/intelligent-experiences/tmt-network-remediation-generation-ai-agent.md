# Network remediation generation AI agent

The agent reads the resolution steps from the work notes of a network incident and maps each step to a task type: incident task, work order, or change request. It then creates the mapped tasks and displays a link to each one.

## Workflow

The agent turns the resolution steps on a network incident into tasks and gives the user a link to each task.

1.  Retrieve the resolution steps from the work notes of the incident and map each step to a task type.
2.  Display the mapped resolution steps, grouped into incident tasks, work orders, and change requests.
3.  Create the tasks from the mapped resolution steps.
4.  Generate a link for each task created.
5.  Display the links, grouped by task type.
