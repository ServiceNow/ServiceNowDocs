# Success risk solution AI agent

The agent resolves unaddressed risk signals. It identifies success plays based on machine learning similarity, AI Search, or a decision table, and starts the solution flows for the selected risk.

## Workflow

The agent helps the user address a risk signal by starting solutions for it.

1.  Retrieve the solutions for the selected risk.
2.  If no solutions are found, display a link to the success play catalog so that the user can add an ad hoc success play, and end the session.
3.  Check the required inputs for each selected solution flow.
4.  Ask the user for each input value, in a logical order such as start date before end date.
5.  Start the solution for the risk with the values that the user provided. Repeat for each selected solution.
6.  Tell the user that solution creation has started, and display a link to the success play catalog for adding an ad hoc success play.
