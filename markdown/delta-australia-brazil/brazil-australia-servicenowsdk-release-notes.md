# Combined ServiceNow SDK release notes for upgrades from Australia to Brazil

Consolidated page of all release notes for ServiceNow SDK from Australia to Brazil.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family ServiceNow SDK release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Australia to Brazil.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

-   **Upgrade information**

To upgrade to the latest version of the ServiceNow SDK globally or within an application, see [Upgrade the ServiceNow SDK](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=upgrade-servicenow-sdk&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

ServiceNow SDK version 4.4 supports integration with ServiceNow instances beginning with the Washington DC release.

On Windows systems, after upgrading to ServiceNow SDK version 4.3 or later, existing stored credentials aren’t supported due to the deprecation of Keytar. Users on Windows systems must add their user credentials again using the `now-sdk auth --add` command to authenticate with instances. For more information, see [Authenticate](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=authenticate-instance-now-sdk&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

**Important:** For minor releases of the ServiceNow SDK, see the [ServiceNow SDK release notes](https://github.com/ServiceNow/sdk/releases) on GitHub.
