# Table data options for pareto bar visualizations

When you select a table data source for a Pareto bar visualization, the following Data configuration options are available.

<table id="table_wqy_sjr_qtb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="sub-head" id="heading-data" colspan="2">

Data

</td></tr><tr><td>

Data source

</td><td>

You have selected a Table data source in [Create a horizontal or vertical bar data visualization](../task/create-dv-bar-ac.md).

**Note:** For pareto charts, only one data source can be defined at any given time.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Metric

</td></tr><tr><td>

Label

</td><td>

Label of the metric. By default it is the same as the name of the data source.**Note:** Only one metric can be defined for a Pareto bar visualization at any given time.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Select an aggregation

</td><td>

Computational method for aggregating data. The default is **Count**, which displays the number of records selected.**Note:** If you select **Count Distinct**, only unique records are counted. For example, you want to generate a report with a distinct number of users who have one or more of the roles in a given list of roles. Users with more than one role would be counted twice unless you use **Count Distinct**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field

</td><td>

Field to apply the metric to, for **Average**, **Sum**, or **Count Distinct** aggregations. You may further be able to aggregate on fields from extended tables.The data is shown in a format that matches the field type. For example, if you select an integer field, such as the **Priority** field, the data is expressed as a number. If you select a duration field, such as **Business duration** on the Incident table, the aggregated data is expressed in days, hours, and minutes.

If function fields were created in Report Designer for the table, they are available in the dropdown list. For more information, see [Report on function fields](../concept/function-fields-reporting.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Format values

</td><td id="entry_format-values">

Select to open the **Formatting values** dialog. For more information, see [Value formatting in reports](value-formatting-reports.md#).

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Formatting values

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use custom formatting

</td><td>

Option to use custom formatting on the component.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Decimal precision

</td><td id="entry_decimal-precision">

Number of decimals to show in the metric. This field is available only when the **Use custom formatting** option is activated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Rounding

</td><td>

Type of rounding to use to reach the number of decimals in the **Decimal precision** field. Options include:-   Up `UP`
-   Down `DOWN`
-   Ceiling `CEILING`
-   Floor `FLOOR`
-   Half up `HALF_UP`
-   Half down `HALF_DOWN`
-   Half even `HALF_EVEN`

 **Note:** Only available when **Use custom formatting** is true.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use the thousands group separator

</td><td>

Option to use a comma to separate groups of thousands.**Note:** Only available when **Use custom formatting** is true.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enable abbreviation

</td><td>

Option to use an alphabetical abbreviation. For example, M to represent million. **Note:** Only available when **Use custom formatting** is true.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Example

</td><td>

Example of the final value to show in the component. **Note:** Only available when **Use custom formatting** is true

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Group by

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field for \[table\]

</td><td>

The field to group by. For example, in an incident report grouped by **Assignment group**, all incidents that belong to Software, Service Desk, and Network are placed in separate groups. If the table contains variables or question fields, you have the option to group by one of them at the end of the list of fields. Only one **Group by** can be defined in the Pareto chart. The **Alternative Group By** can be defined for a Pareto visualization. For vertical bar, horizontal bar, and pivot reports with multiple data sources: If you group the first source by a choice field, you can group the second source by any applicable choice field.

-   It is not possible to group or stack data by the **Tags** field, or by certain field types, such as MEDIUMTEXT.
-   If you want to group by a field with continuous values, such as date or integer, the values are automatically grouped according to any report ranges that are defined for the data. For more information, see [Report ranges](../concept/c_ReportRanges.md#).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Max number of groups

</td><td>

Select the maximum number of groups to display. Groups in excess of this number, determined by sorting, are aggregated into the Others group. You can show that aggregate with the **Show others** option.By default, you cannot show more than 50 groups. If you have the admin role, you can change this limit in the **par\_viz.table\_data.max\_groups** system property.

Data for the Max number of groups is evaluated across all periods in the time series to ensure consistent group membership across all dates in the visualization.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Show others

</td><td>

If **Max number of groups** is set and this option is turned on, an aggregate of the groups beyond the maximum number is displayed as the Others group.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hide elements with values of 0

</td><td>

When toggled on, elements with a value of NULL or 0, such as rows or data points, are not displayed. This control is not available when the metric is COUNT.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add alternative group by

</td><td>

This selection opens a dialog in which you select additional items that the data in the visualization may be grouped by. The viewer of the visualization can then select which of these items to group the data by. The viewer toggles the visibility of the selector in the visualization's More actions menu. In the additional items dialog, you can set whether this selector is visible by default by toggling **Selector visible by default**.If you select a value in **Group by**, that is the default group-by value. You do not have to select a **Group by** value to specify alternative group-by values. In this case, no default group-by value is used.

For more information about setting alternative group-bys for multiple metrics, see [Options for time series data visualizations with multiple metrics](../concept/chart-options-multi-metrics.md). For more information about the viewer experience selecting from alternative group-by values, see [Select a group-by value in a data visualization as a viewer](../../performance-analytics/concept/select-group-runtime.md).

**Important:**

-   Only up to three metrics on one visualization support alternative group-by.
-   Alternative group-by does not support data binding on the data source

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Date range

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply date range

</td><td>

When turned on, this option allows date filters on the dashboard or UIB page to apply to this visualization. The date range can also be configured in the visualization, but date filters override visualization settings.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

Data update

</td></tr><tr><td>

Follow filters

</td><td>

Follow filters set for a page. When enabled, the visualization displays on a workspace with the filters set by the page. Toggle off to disable a visualization from accepting any filter input.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Show filter icon

</td><td>

Option to show the filter icon and the number of filters impacting the visualization. If a filter is not selected to apply to a visualization, the icon does not show. Toggle off to hide the filter icon and number of filters applied.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Refresh after being away for X min.

</td><td>

Triggered when you navigate away from the dashboard that contains the data visualization to another page in the same workspace, includingPlatform Analytics experience. Sets how many minutes you will be on another page before the visualization automatically refreshes when you navigate back.Do not confuse this property with the **Scheduled repetition** setting on inline dashboards. This latter property refreshes the entire dashboard, and applies only while that dashboard is open.

</td></tr><tr><td class="sub-head" colspan="2">

No data message

</td></tr><tr><td>

Set custom message when no data

</td><td>

Option to configure a custom message that displays when no data is returned.

</td></tr><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Content

</td><td>

Secondary text of the message that provides additional detail.

</td></tr><tr><td>
