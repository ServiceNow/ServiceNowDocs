# Service Bridge Health release notes

Version history for the Service Bridge Health on the ServiceNow Store.

**Important:** For details on system requirements and family compatibility, view the application listing on the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website.

## Version history

-   **Version 2.3.18 - June 2026**
    -   Connections tab in the Service Exchange Center: Create, view, request, and offboard provider and consumer connections from a single location in the Service Exchange Center. Search and filter connections without navigating across multiple screens.
    -   Improved consumer registration and onboarding: Onboard consumers faster with a guided, step-by-step registration experience. Upgraded consumers are automatically redirected to this experience to receive clearer progress indicators during onboarding, and actionable messaging for failure and delay scenarios, minimizing onboarding friction and support dependency.
    -   Improved FDS capabilities:
        -   Improve your connection experience by syncing Knowledge Base articles between provider and consumer instances.
        -   Reduce data inconsistencies by maintaining sys IDs for CMDB data and dependent relationships through transform maps.
        -   Ensure CI functionality is preserved on the destination instance by choosing to automatically create CI dependency relationships when relationship data is received from the source.
        -   Improved compliance through restricted data sync from non-production instances to production instances for CMDB tables.
    -   Journal Field Framework enhancements:
        -   Increase flexibility in journal data synchronization between provider and consumer instances by mapping multiple source fields to a single target journal field.
        -   Configure journal fields, such of type journal\_input fields alongside journal type, ensuring all journal entries are preserved during synchronization without requiring custom scripting.
    -   Group-based persona assignments for Remote Catalog: Assign Remote Catalog personas to user groups so existing group-based access management practices extend to Remote Catalog, reducing administrative effort by managing access at the group level instead of individual users.
-   **Version 2.3.15 - May 2026**
    -   Fixed:
        -   Inbound Transform Execution
            -   Resolved an issue where inbound transforms could fail to execute due to permission-related constraints, ensuring reliable data ingestion and processing.
        -   Connection Entitlements Retention
            -   Fixed a condition where entitlements could be lost after a connection was interrupted and later re-established. Entitlements are now consistently preserved across reconnections.
        -   Improved Onboarding Error Handling
            -   Enhanced onboarding behavior so that, if an error occurs in an onboarding flow, a clear error message is presented instead of the process remaining in a “Work in Progress” state.
-   **Version 1.0.7 - April 2026**
    -   New:
        -   Added translations
        -   Change name from Service Bridge to Service Exchange
-   **Version 2.3.9 - March 2026**
    -   New:
        -   Service Exchange Center
            -   Introduced the unified Health Dashboard for improved visibility into connections through a new Heartbeat capability, more accurate connection status, enhanced search and filtering, and centralized issue tracking with validation and resolution.
        -   Documentation
            -   Restructured Service Exchange documentation.
-   **Version 1.0.4 - November 2025**

    Fixes: Scan tasks are automatically closed when subsequent executions produce no new findings.

-   **Version 1.0.3 - September 2025**
    -   Fixed:
        -   Updated scan check to handle "User Not Authenticated" intermittent issue with RPS \(PRB1924176\)
        -   Improved pre-onboarding scan check suite \(PRB1917753\)
-   **Version 1.0.1 - August 2025**

    This application contains the Instance scan audit checks for Service Bridge.
