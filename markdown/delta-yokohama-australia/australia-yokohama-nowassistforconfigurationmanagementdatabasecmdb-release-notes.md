Between your current release family and Australia, new features were introduced for Now Assist for Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

-   **[Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skills are automatically available to appropriate role users for the application, such as ITIL roles on incident forms or change forms. This change simply activates the skill and does not touch the roles that may be needed to use the skill. The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills and agentic workflows are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill, agent, or agentic workflow is turned on automatically \(the AI asset was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills and agentic workflows that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Preview deduplication template results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-cmdb-mng-dupe-cis-skill&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

While you're working in the manage duplicate CIs skill, select **Review existing templates** to help you to decide which deduplication template to apply. Now Assist generates a summary of the results of applying a template without actually running the remediation process. You can preview the results for any existing template. When you see the desired result in a preview, you can specify that template and proceed with the deduplication process.

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ai-native-sku-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets and create your own
Depending on your entitlements, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.


-   **[View CI details on CI forms](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-skill-ci-form-help&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skill answers your questions on CI classes and attributes to help you work in CI forms, dashboards, home pages, and other views on the workspace. You can submit similar queries on the Explore CI view.

-   **[CMDB searches can include relationships](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-awf-search&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Search queries can depend on relationships between CIs and can span multiple tables. For example, you might ask: "Search for servers that depend on databases - only Linux servers running Redhat".

-   **[Search the Service Graph database](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=na-cmdb-skill-search-result-classfy&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Now Assist for CMDB analyzes your search criteria, identifies implicit filters, determines the optimum search method \(keyword search or query generation\), queries Service Graph data, and then displays the results. You then have the option to refine the search using natural language in the Now Assist panel.
