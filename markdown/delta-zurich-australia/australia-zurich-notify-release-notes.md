# Combined Notify release notes for upgrades from Zurich to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Notify from Zurich to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Notify release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Zurich to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Notify to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Starting with the Zurich release, Notify uses subflows instead of workflows. For existing users in Zurich, your current workflows are still supported. For new users, your Notify plugin installations use subflows.

 As part of this transition, the following workflow activities are available as flow actions and can be used when creating subflows:

-   Join conference call
-   Call
-   Send SMS
-   Forward call
-   Input
-   Hangup
-   Play
-   Record
-   Reject
-   Say
-   Forward to notify client
-   Queue

 Maintain, build, and modify your own custom subflows in Workflow Studio with subflows for new instances. The following base system workflows have been migrated to subflows:

-   \(Re\)join Conference Call
-   Join Conference Call with muting
-   Join Conference Call with SMS

Your existing workflows continue to function after the upgrade.

**Note:** All workflow-related artifacts have been moved to a new plugin, which is maintained in a support-only mode and isn't available for new installations.
