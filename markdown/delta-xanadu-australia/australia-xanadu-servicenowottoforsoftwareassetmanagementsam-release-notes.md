-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=monitoring-now-assist-usage&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with Yokohama Patch 5, Now Assist usage measurement is transitioning from a 365-day look-back model to a 365-day burn-down model, with usage resetting at the contract anniversary date. For more information, refer to [KB KB2704710: Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710).

-   **[Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The skills are automatically available to appropriate role users for the application, such as ITIL roles on incident forms or change forms. This change simply activates the skill and does not touch the roles that may be needed to use the skill. The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills and agentic workflows are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Yokohama Patch 11\): Any previously unconfigured skill, agent, or agentic workflow is turned on automatically \(the AI asset was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills and agentic workflows that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Role configuration required for agentic workflows and AI agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=aia-role-masking&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Agentic workflows and AI agents included with Now Assist applications require additional security configuration. If you select **Users with selected roles** for your user access security controls for an agentic workflow or AI agent, you must add the installed roles, or they will not execute. Data access settings must also include these roles. See the documentation for the agentic workflow or AI agent for the specific roles you must add.

-   **Coral theme**

Coral is now the default theme for new portal, web, and mobile experiences with Next Experience or Core UI enabled. This theme provides a fresh look and feel, featuring brand-neutral illustrations to enhance your user experience. A dark theme option is available for web and mobile experiences.

-   **[Troubleshoot button alongside the error message on the Integration profile form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=troubleshooting-saas-now-assist-sam&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The **Troubleshoot** button is available for all SaaS integrations on the error message that is displayed when connection validation fails due to an error. When selected, the button triggers the generation of error summary and resolution guidance.
