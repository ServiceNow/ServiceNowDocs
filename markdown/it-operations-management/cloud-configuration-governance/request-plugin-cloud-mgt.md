# Request the Cloud Provisioning and Governance application

The Cloud Provisioning and Governance application is available as a separate subscription and requires the Cloud Provisioning and Governance plugin \(com.snc.cloud.mgmt\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

To purchase a subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. The account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  On the All Applications page, select **Request Plugin** to open the **Activate Plugin** form on Now Support.
