# Azure Recovery Services Vault pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Azure services on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify the Microsoft Azure discovery prerequisites**

    For more information, see the prerequisites section in [Microsoft Azure Cloud discovery using patterns](../service-mapping/reference/azure-cloud-discovery-patterns.md).

-   **Enable the relevant pattern**

    The pattern for this service is disabled by default. Starting with Visibility Content version 6.28.0, activating or deactivating a pattern won't be considered a customization, and it will continue to receive updates. Patterns that were previously activated or deactivated will reset to the latest predefined version after upgrading while retaining the last active field value. For more information on enabling patterns, see [Activate a disabled pattern](../service-mapping/task/activate-disabled-pattern.md).

-   **Configure the Discovery schedule to support GovCloud**

    Discovering Azure GovCloud \(US\) accounts requires using a datacenter URL when setting up an Azure service account. For more information, see [Set up Azure service accounts](../it-operations-management/task/setup-azure-service-accounts.md).


Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in both CMDB and non-CMDB tables.

## Data stored in non-CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the non-CMDB table when running the Azure - Recovery Services Vault - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

You can review the non-CMDB Azure tables by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Azure**. You can also search the navigation filter for the specific pattern name.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Object Id \[object\_id\]|The unique resource identifier for the Azure resource.|
|Kind \[kind\]|The resource kind, indicating its specific variant or implementation.|
|DC Location \[location\]|The Azure region where the resource is deployed.|
|Resource Group \[resource\_group\]|The name of the resource group containing the resource.|
|Subscription Id \[subscription\_id\]|The Azure subscription ID under which the resource exists.|
|Tenant Id \[tenant\_id\]|The Azure Active Directory tenant ID associated with the resource.|
|Provisioning State \[provisioning\_state\]|The current provisioning state of the resource. For example: Succeeded, Failed, or Updating.|
|Configuration Item \[configuration\_item\]|References the Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\] table.|

## Data stored in CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the CMDB when running the Azure - Recovery Services Vault - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Object ID \[object\_id\]|The unique resource identifier for the Azure resource.|
|Name \[name\]|The name assigned to the resource.|
|Location \[location\]|The Azure region where the resource is deployed.|
|Install Status \[install\_status\]|Install status of the resource. Default value is Installed.|
|Operational status \[operational\_status\]|Operational status of the resource. Default value is Operational.|
|Resource type \[resource\_type\]|Type of resource. The value is set to **microsoft.recoveryservices/vaults**.|

## CI relationships

The Azure - Recovery Services Vault - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern creates these relationships to support Azure Recovery Services Vault discovery.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|Resource Group \[cmdb\_ci\_resource\_group\]|Contains::Contained by|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|Hosted on::Hosts|Azure Datacenter \[cmdb\_ci\_azure\_datacenter\]|
|Azure Recovery Services - Vault \[cmdb\_azure\_recovery\_services\_vault\]|References|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|

## Azure tag discovery

The pattern collects tags and populates them in the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Key \[key\]|Tag name.|
|Value \[value\]|Tag value.|
