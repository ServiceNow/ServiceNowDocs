# Azure Compute Gallery Image Definition pattern-based discovery

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns finds Azure services on your cloud environment. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Pattern-based discovery and mapping requirements

-   **Verify the Microsoft Azure discovery prerequisites**

    For more information, see the prerequisites section in [Microsoft Azure Cloud components discovery using patterns](../service-mapping/reference/azure-cloud-discovery-patterns.md).

-   **Enable the relevant pattern**

    The pattern for this service is disabled by default. Starting with Visibility Content version 6.28.0, activating or deactivating a pattern won't be considered a customization, and it will continue to receive updates. Patterns that were previously activated or deactivated will reset to the latest predefined version after upgrading while retaining the last active field value. For more information on enabling patterns, see [Activate a disabled pattern](../service-mapping/task/activate-disabled-pattern.md).

-   **Configure the Discovery schedule to support GovCloud**

    Discovering Azure GovCloud \(US\) accounts requires using a datacenter URL when setting up an Azure service account. For more information, see [Set up Azure service accounts](../it-operations-management/task/setup-azure-service-accounts.md).


Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in both CMDB and non-CMDB tables.

## Data stored in non-CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the non-CMDB table when running the Azure - Compute Gallery Image Definition - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

You can review the non-CMDB Azure tables by navigating to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Azure**. You can also search the navigation filter for the specific pattern name.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Architecture \[architecture\]|Central processing unit \(CPU\) architecture of the resource, such as x86 or ARM.|
|Hyper-V Generation \[hyper\_v\_generation\]|The Hyper-V generation version of the virtual machine.|
|Kind \[kind\]|The specific subcategory or variation type of the resource.|
|Location \[location\]|The geographical region where the resource is deployed.|
|Object Id \[object\_id\]|The unique identifier of the resource.|
|OS Type \[os\_type\]|The operating system type associated with the resource.|
|Provisioning State \[provisioning\_state\]|Current provisioning status of the resource.|
|Resource Group \[resource\_group\]|Name of the resource group.|
|SKU \[sku\]|The stock keeping unit \(SKU\) that defines the pricing tier of the resource.|
|Subscription ID \[subscription\_id\]|The subscription ID.|
|Tenant ID \[tenant\_id\]|The unique identifier for the Azure Active Directory tenant.|
|Configuration Item \[configuration\_item\]|References the Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\] table.|

## Data stored in CMDB tables

Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application populates data in the CMDB when running the Azure - Compute Gallery Image Definition - Extended Inventory\(LP\) pattern.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Install Status \[install\_status\]|Install status of the resource. Default value is Installed.|
|Location \[location\]|The geographical region where the resource is deployed.|
|Name \[name\]|The name given to the resource.|
|Object ID \[object\_id\]|The unique identifier of the resource.|
|Operational status \[operational\_status\]|Operational status of the resource. Default value is Operational.|
|Resource type \[resource\_type\]|Type of resource. The value is set to **microsoft.compute/galleries/images**.|

## CI relationships

The pattern creates these relationships to support discovery.

|CI|Relationship|CI|
|---|------------|---|
|Resource Group \[cmdb\_ci\_resource\_group\]|Contains::Contained by|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|
|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|Hosted on::Hosts|Azure Datacenter \[cmdb\_ci\_azure\_datacenter\]|
|Azure Compute Gallery - Image Definition \[cmdb\_azure\_compute\_gallery\_image\_definition\]|References|Cloud Resource \[cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource\]|

## Azure tag discovery

The pattern collects tags and populates them in the Key Value \[cmdb\_key\_value\] table.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Key \[key\]|Tag name.|
|Value \[value\]|Tag value.|
